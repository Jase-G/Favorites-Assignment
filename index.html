      I have many favorite things. Obviously, I love my family, home, and belongings more than anything in the world. However, to avoid filling this website with clichés, I will list other things instead.

    <h1>1. Food</h1>
    <h3>Not just any food, my favorite foods.</h3>
    <p>
      I love food, but not all food. Some food is better than others, and I have my preferences. My favorite meals are the ones I think are impossible to beat. All of the meals I list will be homemade because homemade is where the best meals are made.

    <!-- Lasagna -->
    <h2>1. Lasagna</h2>
    <img id="lasagna" src="images/lasagna, mmmmmm.jpg" alt="lasagna" />
    <p>
      In my opinion, if you pair the right ingredients with the best recipe, you get the best meal ever conceived. This meal is the perfect mix of ingredients; it covers every category of the Canada Food Guide, including dairy, protein, carbs, and vegetables.

    <!-- Bowtie Pasta Salad -->
    <h2>2. Bowtie Pasta Salad</h2>
    <img src="images/best salad ever.jpg" alt="salad" />
    <p>
      Of all the healthy meals, this is not the healthiest. This meal has a lot of pasta, making it high in carbs. However, it makes up for its lack of healthiness by being the most delicious salad there is. This salad has all the perfect ingredients: cottage cheese, bowtie pasta, various herbs, cherry tomatoes, and Italian dressing.

    <!-- Cream Soda Float -->
    <h2>3. Cream Soda Float</h2>

    <p>
      As a dessert drink, a Cream Soda Float covers all the requirements to be horrible for your body, but delicious at the same time. This drink consists of cream soda of any kind, vanilla ice cream, and any topping you want; it is truly the best dessert ever to exist in my opinion. Not only can you have it with cream soda, but you can also enjoy it with different kinds of soda, like Coca-Cola and ginger ale.  Another alternative to a Cream soda float is a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/easy-roy-rogers-recipe-759797">Roy Rogers</a>, a mocktail that consits of a Coca Cola and Grenadine.

    <p>
      There is no discussion in my opinion that this game is the best, especially for one made in 2016. This game is the Holy Grail of video games; it has the best combat, the best movement, the best story, and the best mechanics of any game.  This game was released between two gaming behemoths and still stood tall. Best game ever—no discussion in my opinion. On top of this, there are giant robots called Titans, and there are a total of seven Titans.  See more about Titanfall 2 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ea.com/games/titanfall/titanfall-2">here</a>.
      <ul>

        <li>Scorch</li>
        <li>Ronin</li>
        <li>Ion</li>
        <li>Tone</li>
        This list is in order as the pictures of the Titans above.

    <p>

With its cute style, anyone can love this game. I have spent countless hours playing it and have regretted nothing.

    <!-- Hollow Knight -->
    <h2>3. Hollow Knight</h2>
    <img src="images/Hollow Knight.jpg" alt="hollow knight" />
    <p>
      Hollow Knight is an extremely difficult game with lots of combat that requires plenty of practice. It took me months to master the combat system. Even then, combat is not all this game has to offer. It has an award-worthy story and so much to do (including the DLCs) that you can achieve 112% completion. There is so much to explore that it could take years to complete. I have been playing this game for years and still have not finished it.
